# 🧠 ConnectForge

A powerful hub for interacting with tools and services through a conversational **LLM interface**, seamlessly integrated with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem.  
ConnectForge enables you to chat naturally while executing tasks via connected MCP servers—such as GitHub automation, math computations, file operations, web search, and more—through a modular and extensible **multi-agent architecture**.

### 🔧 Environment Setup (Backend)

To get started, first **clone the repository**:

Before running the backend, make sure to configure your environment variables in a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder. Refer to the `.env-example` file for the correct structure. You **must** provide the following values:

- `DATABASE_URL`: This should point to the PostgreSQL database using the credentials defined in your Docker setup. Example:

```bash
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}
```

- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key to use LangChain Groq LLM provider (preferred)

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key to use LangChain OpenAI LLM Provider

Ensure all these variables are properly set before starting the backend services.

### 🚀 Running the Project with Docker

This project includes both backend and frontend services, and you can run them together using Docker. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project root directory**.

2. **Bring down any running Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Build the Docker images**:

   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

4. **Start the containers**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Once the containers are up, you can access the project on your local machine by going to: `backend`
This will run both the backend and frontend services on localhost using the Docker setup.
You will now be able to access the interactive interface running at `http://localhost:3000/agents`

# 🧩 Agent Configuration

The agent is configured using a JSON block similar to the example below.  
You can also view the full configuration example in [`sample_config.txt`](./sample_config.txt) in the project root with detailed description of each key.

```json
{
  "agentConfig": {
    "agent_name": "GitHub AI Assistant",
    "description": "An AI-powered assistant that can perform GitHub actions, math calculations, and access local files.",
    "tags": ["code", "productivity"],
    "llm": {
      "provider": "groq",
      "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
      "max_tokens": 1000,
      "temperature": 0,
      "timeout": 10,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "n_history_messages": 4
    },
    "prompt": {
      "system_message": "You are a helpful assistant with access to tools..."
    }
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Modify variables in `agentConfig` section of json to play around with LLM configs and agent behaviour. This will come in handy especially when using free tier of Groq or OpenAI API Keys when running in errors or blockers during chat with agent.

# ✅ Getting Started: Working Examples

Here are tested and working examples of `mcpServers` configurations that you can regsiter via the UI directly when registering/editing the agents.
Click to expand each section and copy-paste directly into your configuration JSON.

### 🔧 Github Agent

  <details> <summary> GitHub </summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
    }
  }
}
```

> Make sure to replace provide your `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, Do not replace teh path in args when running in Docker.

  </details>

### 🤖 Github-Extended Agent

  <details> <summary> GitHub Extended </summary>
  We have implemented a custom PR summarizer in our backend code which can be used to extend the tools of GitHub mcp server above by simply extending the mcpServers dictionary in UI when adding/editing the agent config as explained below:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
    }
  },
  "github-summarizer": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["/app/app/mcp/servers/github.py"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: No need to change file path in args as you will be running the app in docker container

  </details>

### 🛢️PostgreSQL Agent

  <details> <summary> PostgreSQL</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "postgres": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",
      "postgresql://localhost/mydb"
    ]
  }
}

```

> Make sure the database connection string points to a valid running PostgreSQL instance.

  </details>

### 🧠 Sequential Thinking Agent

  <details> <summary>Sequential Thinking</summary>

```json

"mcpServers": {
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  }
}

```

  </details>

### 🗂️ Filesystem Agent

  <details> <summary>Filesystem</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/app/"
    ]
  }
}

```

> NOTE: Do not replace path `/app/` when running with docker. Otherwise, you can specify as many files or directories you like in args

  </details>

For more such examples, you can test available servers at: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
However, do note that not all would work as expected.

# Example Prompts

To get started with any agent after sucecssful agent registration from the interface, you can try few of the initial prompts:

- List the tools you have along with their arguments or variables, if any
- List down the tasks you can perform
- List down the tools you have access to

# 🚀 Key Features

- **Agent Registration**: Easily register agents using a configurable JSON structure compatible with Claude Desktop or any external MCP server.

- **Multi-Agent Support**: Combine multiple MCP server configurations to extend functionality or run multiple agents concurrently.

- **Dashboard Monitoring**: Track agent interactions and system performance via a dedicated UI.

- **Chat History**: View historical conversations (single-agent only).

- **Extendable Tools**: Add custom external tools by updating the `mcpServers` configuration block.

- **Tool Chaining Support**: Supported in the MCP Chat Client.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer                 | Technology                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Frontend**          | React                      |
| **Backend API**       | Django REST Framework      |
| **Agent Core**        | Python (`mcp-use` library) |
| **LLM Orchestration** | LangChain                  |

# 🌐 MCP Server Types Supported

- **Stdio Connectors**: Run via tools like `npx`, `uv`, or `python3`.

- **HTTP Connectors**: Integrate REST APIs by specifying base URLs and authorization headers.

- **WebSocket Connectors**: Enable real-time tool interactions using `ws_url`.

## ➕ Adding New Tools

To add or extend tools:

- Update the `mcpServers` section in your agent config.
- Ensure the tool is compatible with the MCP protocol (Stdio, HTTP, or WebSocket).
- Provide necessary environment variables and authentication tokens.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ Multi-agent chat history is not yet supported.
- ⚠️ Free-tier LLMs may sometimes result in failed responses or random delays
- 🔄 System prompt tuning may be necessary for consistent results.
- 🧪 Toolchain compatibility has not been verified with all open-source MCP servers.
- ✅ Currently supports `npx`, `uv`, `python`-based MCP tool connectors.
